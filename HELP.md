"""OPTIMUS_MEGABYTE can help you in the following ways: 
1) The Plus function!, all you need to do is type '+ numbers' for example '+ 5 2 3 6 4' ans voila the sum is right there in front of you. 
2) The Product function!, example '* 5 6 2 5 4' and as easy as that you can compute multiplication of as many numbers as you want !!! 
3) Root finding of a Polynomial function, example:- 'roots a b c d' where a, b, c, d are the coefficients of the function of degree 4 in this case.
4) Differetiation of a Polynomial function !!, example:- 'diff n a b c' where n is the degree and a, b, c are the coefficients. #DON'T FORGET THE ZEROS!! """)
